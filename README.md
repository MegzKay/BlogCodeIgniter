## About
Welcome to this blog created by [Brad Traversy](https://github.com/bradtraversy/ciblog). It is made using the code ignitor framework

I have finished the tutorial and have began to further develop the blog. The following items have been made or had changes to:

 * Validation error message moved next to the specific form field
 * Pagination for posts linked to a specific category
 * Changed comment functionality. Need to login to create a comment, which then it takes the sessions user_id and username attributes instead of form fields
 * Contact form added
 * Added Ajax functionality for comments. When submitted, ajax call is made to store new comment, and returned is the new comment which is then displayed on top of previous comments
