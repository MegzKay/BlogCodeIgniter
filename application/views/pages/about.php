            Brad Traversy</a>. It is made using the code ignitor framework</p>
<p>I have finished the tutorial and have began to further develop the blog</p>
<ul>
    <li>Validation error message moved next to the specific form field</li>
    <li>Pagination for posts linked to a specific category</li>
    <li>Changed comment functionality. Need to login to create a comment, which then it 
        takes the sessions user_id and username attributes instead of form fields</li>
</ul>
